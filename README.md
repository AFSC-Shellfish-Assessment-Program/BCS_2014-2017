## Abstract
Bering Sea Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) and snow crab (C. opilio) populations have reached historic lows in recent years, although factors affecting recruitment and productivity are poorly understood. Bitter crab disease, a fatal parasitic dinoflagellate infection (Hematodinium sp.), represents a proximate mechanism for mortality in Bering Sea crab stocks, although disease dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we employ conventional PCR techniques to detect Hematodinium infections at eastern Bering Sea Tanner and snow crab monitoring sites to 1) compare testing accuracy of disease detection methods, 2) estimate Hematodinium infection prevalence from 2015 - 2017, and 3) investigate drivers of Hematodinium infection. We confirm that visual diagnostic methods are highly insensitive for detecting Hematodinium infections and misclassify 93% of infections detected by molecular methods. Using Bayesian regression models, our results show that Hematodinium infection risk is highly dependent on host size, sex and sampling date. Small Tanner crab (<30mm carapace width) were nearly twice as susceptible to infection than larger individuals, while female snow crab exhibited a 9.3% increase in Hematodinium infection probability over males. Most notably, we detected peak prevalences exceeding 50% at several Tanner and snow crab monitoring sites in 2017, and we emphasize the severe population-level consequences for this nearly 4-fold increase in prevalence from past studies. Our empirical modeling approach provides the first step in developing predictive models for bitter crab disease dynamics in Tanner and snow crab, and highlights the critical importance of continued monitoring and mechanistic modeling of bitter crab disease in the Bering Sea.
